# Xcode-Templates

A small collection of handcrafted Xcode templates.

If you find one of the templates particularly useful then just copy the respective directory to `/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/`. You may have to create this directory yourself.

## Prototyping

This template provides a starting point for an interactive prototype. Just supply an URL to the created prototype (e.g. from [Marvelapp](http://marvelapp.com)) and the template will automatically create a fullscreen web view to display the prototype.
